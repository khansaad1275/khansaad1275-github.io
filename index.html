    <h1>Saad Maqsood</h1>
    <p>Hey, I’m Saad. I’ve been on a journey from learning to code in college to building open-source projects that solve real problems. Here's a glimpse of what I've been up to.</p>
    
    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>From my first "Hello, World!" program to creating tools that make life easier for others, I’ve always been passionate about programming. My journey started at Mumbai University, where I found my love for coding and cybersecurity. Over time, I’ve honed my skills in Python, BASH, and automation.</p>

  
    <h2>What I’m Working On</h2>
    <p>I’m always learning and exploring new areas in tech. Right now, I’m diving deeper into open-source contributions and expanding my knowledge in red teaming and cybersecurity.</p>
